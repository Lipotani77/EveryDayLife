# EveryDayLife
Web Programming project, P2-S4  
Link to the github : https://github.com/Lipotani77/EveryDayLife.git


## Introduction 
  This project aims to create an educational website about Sustainable Development Goals 14 and 15, focusing on endangered species and raising awareness about how to protect them. The website will maintain a fun and engaging tone to make learning about these animals enjoyable, encouraging users to stay, explore, and interact with content about these endangered species.

## Usage
When you arrive on the Home page of our website, you'll find QCMs and games focused on sea and land animals, accessible through the navigation bar under the "Sea Life" and "Earth Life" sections. However, before you access these quizzes, we invite you to first discover the animals. To do this, start on the Home page by clicking on the Earth icon. This will open a pop-up window with a map. When you hover over the pins on the map, an image of an animal will appear. Clicking on the image will take you to a dedicated page containing videos, audio clips, and articles about that animal in order to learn more about them.

Finally, you can access the "About" page either via clicking on the students pictures on the Home page or via the footer (intentionally not in the navigation bar) to learn about our vision and contributions to this project, and to find a direct link to the GitHub repository.

## Features
We designed this website to be both educational and engaging by adding fun, interactive elements that help users enjoy learning. Here are the main features:

### QCMs
This feature is perfect for competitive users who want to test their newly acquired knowledge.

### Taquin Game
We included Taquin (sliding puzzle) games featuring images of the animals. These games provide entertainment while encouraging user interaction.

## Additional Features
To enhance the website experience, we've included various types of media, such as videos and audio clips to appeal to a wide range of users. In addition to interactive elements, we also offer simple articles for those who prefer a quieter, more traditional way of learning. Small animations are scattered throughout the site to keep it visually engaging and encourage exploration.

We hope you have a nice time navigating through our website :)
